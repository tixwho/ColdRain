# ColdRain
A stupid project trying to get rid of all kinds of cloud musics with local playlist control.


## Tired of Cloud music service? ColdRain's here.

ColdRain is a Playlist Management Software (a.k.a. NOT A MUSIC PLAYER) designed to provide Cloud-service level playlist & metadata control for local music lovers.

#### USAGE:
Metadata Control: Album/Artist alias, different versions of the same song...scan automatically and minimize manual operations.
Playlist Control: Save playlist into different formats, fix playlist song path (based on metadata & audioMD5)
Tag: Assign tags to song, albums, playlists for enhanced searching.

#### ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
CloudService playlist export: smoother transition, audomatically export locally cached cloud music service playlist into universal format. (Now support: NCM)
CloudService playlist backup: playlist backup & version control. Especially useful when your cloudmusic service providers hide your songs without reasons.

#### ADD-ONS (Disclaimer: refer to 3rd party software. ColdRain is not providing any decrypting tool):
Copyright file bump: link with outside applications to automatically bump copyright files into universal format, and recover related playlists.

#### PLANNING:
Add-ons for mainstream local players (foobar2000, musicbee) to link playlist in real time.
Private cloud server.

##### Struct:
Backend - Java, Hibernate, Jetty
Frontend - Javascript (Electron)
